Classification:
===============

- Rewrite the Parzen classifier from scratch. Look up some good source
  to get rid of this covariance estimation.

- Add feature scaling to the XML model structure.


Feature Selection:
==================

- Introduce a flag to delay the matrix inversion stuff in the criterion
  functions (Fisher, Bhattacharyya, Chernoff). From a numerical point of
  view, matrix inversion in more stable for subsets. For nested subset
  methods, matrix inversion on the original problem might not work at all.

- Introduce a flag that does not only delay the matrix inversion, but the
  whole matrix estimation for statistical distance measures. For huge
  subset sizes, the memory requirements will be enormous, since the 
  required space grows quadratic with the number of features.

Statistics:
===========

- Write some good statistical test for multivariate distributions of 
  moderate dimension.


Design Issues:
==============

- Use some 'setParameter(String name, Object value)' to allow arbitrary 
  parameters for classifiers. Classifiers might require other parameters 
  than doubles, vectors, or matrices. Maybe create an interface
  'Parameterizable'.

- Create an interface 'Exportable' and/or 'XMLExportable' that takes out
  the 'export()' method from the 'Classifier' interface. Maybe this can
  be solved by writing some Java5 annotations @Export and @Import that
  completely abstracts the IO from the feature selection and classification
  interfaces (see for instance the @Test annotation in JUnit 4). 

- Allow sparse LibSVM files. If indices are omitted, there value migth be
  assumed to be 0.0.

- Get rid of the '.properties' files in 'resources/'.
